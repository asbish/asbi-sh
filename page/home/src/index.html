  Hi. My name is Yu Ishii. I worked as a commercial sculptor about 10 years and
  now I'm a programmer by profession. I've been enjoying programming in several
  languages since meeting with BASIC on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-7">my first computer</a> that I got
  from my father at the age of 10. My current interests are UI/UX, Geometry and
  related fields in domain-specific language.
</p>
<p class="home-text">
  I use this site to locate silly programs,
  <a href="/pictures">private sculpting stuffs and scribbles</a>. Also all the
  sources in this site are on <a href="https://github.com/asbish">GitHub</a>. If
  you find any interests, feel free to <a href="mailto:asobuishii@gmail.com">contact me</a> ðŸ˜€
